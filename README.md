# covid_beds_occupation_br

Here I analyzed the occupation of hospital beds because of COVID-19 in Brazil. The 2 datasets had more than 2 million records and Github doesn't allow me to upload them. However, you can find links to them at the bottom of my report. Reach out to me if you have any questions.
